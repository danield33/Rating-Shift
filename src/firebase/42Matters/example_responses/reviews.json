Push notifications for groups I‚Äôm not even in & fb WATCH. I turn it off, it‚Äôs STILL THERE! Why do I want to get notifications nonstop about groups I‚Äôm not in?! The shortcut bar nonstop changes. Sometimes the profile button is there, sometimes it‚Äôs not. Make up your minds! -Featured Photos literally AREN‚ÄôT featured anymore! So instead of having them all where people can easily see them you make it so people HAVE to click it to look though. Dumb move. -Why did you remove the poll feature?!! One of my favorite things was to create polls. - WHY isn‚Äôt there an option to rearrange photo albums? I‚Äôll never understand this because the option used to be there & then you took it away. Why? -WHY did you take away the option of moving pics from 1 album to another via phone? You can only do this via desktop now. Another case of taking away a useful function for who knows what reason. -Can‚Äôt move videos to another album at all. Once they‚Äôre in a specific album that‚Äôs it for life. -STILL can‚Äôt delete timeline & mobile uploads albums. Even tho they are completely empty!",
